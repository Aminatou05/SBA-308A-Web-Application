# SBA-308A-Web-Application

In this application, I used asynchronous functions and methods of JavaScript to build a responsive web application. Using fetch data from a remote API and output that data into an HTML page. The API I used is TheCocktailDB a free API with over 600 cocktail recipes and doesnâ€™t require an account to access.
built a page that fetches a random cocktail recipe like the following
created an async function using the Fetch API to fetch a new recipe.

A Function to display the cocktail Data, cocktail name, cocktail image,cocktail ingredients, and newRecipeBtn in the HTML so that you can click on it to get a new Recipe.

Also, I added an Event listener for the button to display the initial recipe when the page loads.
